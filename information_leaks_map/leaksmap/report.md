# Report on System Improvements and Additions

## 1. Data Leak Detection

### Current Implementation
- The system currently supports checking for data leaks using a single API service (LeakCheck).
- The `Breach` model includes fields for `service_name`, `breach_date`, and `description`.

### Required Improvements
- **Support for Multiple Data Sources**: The system should support multiple data sources with the ability to scale. This can be achieved by refactoring the `LeakCheckAPIClient` to support multiple API services and allowing users to configure which services to use.
- **Add Fields for Location and Type of Compromised Data**: The `Breach` model should include fields for the location of the breach and the type of compromised data to support visualization and filtering.

## 2. Visualization

### Current Implementation
- The system does not currently provide a graphical representation of breaches.

### Required Improvements
- **Map or Diagram of Connections**: Implement a map or diagram of connections for breaches, showing the time, location, and type of compromised data.
- **Chronological Journal with Filtering**: Add a chronological journal of events with filtering options by type of data, service, and date.

## 3. Notifications

### Current Implementation
- The system does not currently support multiple notification channels.

### Required Improvements
- **Multiple Notification Channels**: Implement support for email, Telegram, and Push notifications to alert users of new breaches in real-time.

## 4. Recommendations and Help

### Current Implementation
- The system does not currently provide automatic generation of checklists or standard security advice.

### Required Improvements
- **Automatic Generation of Checklists**: Implement automatic generation of checklists for users to follow when a breach is detected.
- **Standard Security Advice**: Provide standard security advice and best practices for users to follow.

## 5. Data Export

### Current Implementation
- The system currently supports exporting reports in plain text format.

### Required Improvements
- **Support for PDF and HTML Formats**: Add support for exporting reports in PDF and HTML formats, including found breaches and recommendations for their resolution.

## 6. UI Improvements

### Current Implementation
- The home page does not currently provide a form for data input.
- The `check_leaks.html` file does not include a map or diagram of connections.

### Required Improvements
- **Add Form for Data Input**: Add a form for data input on the home page to allow users to easily check for breaches.
- **Add Map or Diagram of Connections**: Include a map or diagram of connections in the `check_leaks.html` file to provide a visual representation of breaches.

By implementing these improvements and additions, the system will fully meet the requirements specified in the ТЗ and provide a comprehensive solution for monitoring and managing data leaks.
